Gemma [GEMMA, G]
</h1>
Gemma is a layer 1, decentralized cryptocurrency that launched on April 5th, 2025. It was designed for micropayments and tipping, along with a platform to create your own assets right on the blockchain. Transactions are fully secured with proof-of-work GPU mining using KAWPOW, protecting decentralization with ASIC resistance forever.
<br/><br/>
The Gemma Core software acts as a wallet and allows anyone to operate a node for the Gemma blockchain and use the KAWPOW hashing method for Proof of Work.

<font face="Verdana"><b>Running a Full Node</b></font>

Running a full node helps contribute to the Gemma network's security and decentralization by relaying data to other nodes and verifying transactions. If you would like to run a full node, simply download the Gemma Core wallet, let the blockchain fully sync, and ensure your network has port 4682 forwarded to allow incoming connections.
